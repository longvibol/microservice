Challenge 7 : Observability and Monitoring 

- Trace transaction across multiple service
- combine all the logs form multiple service 
- How to monitoring performace of the service calls? 
- Monitoring Metrics (CUP, network, Ram and health

Observability vs Monitoring 

**** Observabiltiy = សង្កេត ថាតើ វាមានបញ្ហាមកពីអ្វី Collecting and analyzing data
Three pillars of the observability :

1. Metrics : CPU usage, memory usage, and response times. 

2. Logs : ជា record នៃព្រឹត្តិការណ៍ដែលយើងបានដាក់ system 

3. Traces: record path tracing 


 
*** Monitoring = alert and identify the troubleshoot problems 

- Identify and troubleshooting problems
- Track the health of your microservices តាមដាន់សុខភាពរបស់ service នីមួយៗ
- Optimize your microservices: ឧទាហរណ៍ថា service យើងវា connecto to DB ច្រើនដល់ពេកចឹង យើងត្រូវធ្វើការប្តូរ Algorithem vir 

Monitoring is reacting to problems while observability is fixing them in real time. 

+ Logs: record of events that happen in software applications over time
type : trace, debug, info, warn, and error. 

- in monolithic apps : all of the code is in a single codebase. 
- in Microservices   : centralized logging all of the service log 

==> we use Grafana open-source analytics and interatice visualization web application. 

- Grafana is a popular tool for visualizing metrics, logs, traces from a variety of sources. 

+ Loki 
+ Promtail : lightweight log agent that ships logs from your containers to loki. 

Hight level:

1. Promtail fetches logs from the Microservice then it forward logs to Loki (storage text : log aggregation system)

2. Grafana is the Query, search, visualize the logs from Loki  

------------------ Install Grafana Loki
