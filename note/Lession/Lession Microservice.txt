Listion Microservice

- image : have libarary, application code that can make the code running 
- one image can crate many container 
- from image to docker client we use Docker CLI 
when we push to docker hub (it call Docker Registry) 


* Cloud Native Application 
- propose we want to deploy everythere and can work in every enviroment, have small service to working on specifice purpose 
How can we make Cloud Native App

1. Microservice : create small service 
2. Containers : package 
3. DevOps : running process
4. Continouse deliver: easy to add new feature 

best pratice to buil Cloud Native App : 12 factore: https://12factor.net/

1. Codebase: one modul have one code base to working for the server: account server, loan service ...
2. Dependencies : same version crate (pow.xml - verion lombok...) local repository for java name .m2
3. Config : store configuration outside the software code 

Ex: spring.datasource.url= jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/account_service
this is production URL so we much serperate from the production, then we can inject later on. 

4. Backing service: can swap from local connection to another connect without change the code 

5. Build, Release Run : Complily serperate each order
Build Stage + Configuration =  Release stages

6. Processes : want stateless process: 
- statless we don't stort in DB, share-nothing  

JWT: store in stateless for user authentication 

ពីមុន Data ជាច្រើនត្រូវបាន Store នៅក្នុង Session 
- statefull : store 


7. Port Binding: self-contained mean run without depenon another 

8. Concurrency: process ជាច្រើនក្នុងពេលតែមួយ ដូចជា អ្នកប្រើប្រាស់ជាច្រើន Access to server 
- scale up or scale down 
- servie busy or some server are free 

Ex: Scale up: increse size of RAM, CPU (every add up with new hardware): virturl machine 
Ex: scale out or horizontal : Add more instance (add service 1 cpu/ 1 GB Ram) in one docker engine : vertual os

9. Diposability ពេលណាប្រើចាំប្រើ បើអត់ចាំបាត់កុំប្រើ
start up and and shutdown (docker ochestra) 

10. Dev/ Prod parity(ស្មើរភាពគ្នា) : ដាក់លក្ខណកុំអោយខុសគ្នាពេល Enviroment similar use docker 

11. Logs : many service need to create log and we want to see the log file :create sentrolive log
-wirte logs it call logstash -> Elastic Search -> Kibana 

12. Admin Process: Task can include data cleanup : serperate from produciton environment 
- Migration process ( need automatic automachine) 

run data insert table data, it is take time to create manule one by one. 
We need automatice to control   

Microser challenge: 

1 Change size 
2 Portation Run account inviroment 
3. Scalabilty docker and container technolgy, 

Configuration need to managerment
