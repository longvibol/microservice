Challenge 6  : Routing, Cross Cutting Concern 

- Signle entry point problem 
- gateKeeper need to check 
- Cross Cutting Concern:  logging, auditing, tracing, security 
- Url have Static and dynamic (យើងអាច Rout ទៅយកversion ជាក់លាក់ណាមួយបាន)

*** Use Edge Server or API Gateway *** 

Why we need API Gateway?
1. Maintain signle Entrypoint : ទៅរកតែម្នាក់នឹង
2. Cross Cutting Concern : 
save time: no need to have duplicate code, inconsistence behavior
- we should be the comman libary to apply standat 

* Regression Test ធ្វើតេស្តឡើងវិញ
* Regression Bug: first work --> add new feature --> Not working 

3. Route based on custom requirment: Dynmic routing 

* cascading failures : fail after one service is fail.
* cascading delete: if we delete strong entity after the below entiy also delet) 
* downstream services : សើវេស ហៅតគ្នា

==> Authentication and authorization mechanisms can be implemented at the edage server 
==> Full control 


--------------------------------------------

API Gateways is the server ==> How to implement it: we use Spring Cloud Gateway

- Stream line by emphasizing ease and efficiency. 
- It use reactive framework (reactive = non blocking) ល្បឿនលឿន
- Reactive don't block thread (request) 
- វានៅចន្លោះ រវាង អ្នក Request និង Resource 
- Inbound traffice Request ចូលមកនិងឆ្លើងកាត់ API Gateway នឹង
- API gateway ជា concerp and spring cloud gateway ជា Implementation 
spring cloud gateway the same as Spring developer. 

==> Spring cloud gateway is the middle of the request and resource : we can intercepts, analyzes, modifies every request. 


1. Client -> Gateway handler -> Predicate -> Pre Filter -> Post Filter->Resource-> Post Filter> Gateway handlter -> Client 

** Pre Filter : validation->include & exclude list-> authen&autoh->Rate limit->Day.....
** Post Filter : log time process and user log
