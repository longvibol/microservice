Challenge 6  : Routing, Cross Cutting Concern 

- Signle entry point problem 
- gateKeeper need to check 
- Cross Cutting Concern:  logging, auditing, tracing, security 
- Url have Static and dynamic (យើងអាច Rout ទៅយកversion ជាក់លាក់ណាមួយបាន)

*** Use Edge Server or API Gateway *** 

Why we need API Gateway?
1. Maintain signle Entrypoint : ទៅរកតែម្នាក់នឹង
2. Cross Cutting Concern : 
save time: no need to have duplicate code, inconsistence behavior
- we should be the comman libary to apply standat 

* Regression Test ធ្វើតេស្តឡើងវិញ
* Regression Bug: first work --> add new feature --> Not working 

3. Route based on custom requirment: Dynmic routing 

* cascading failures : fail after one service is fail.
* cascading delete: if we delete strong entity after the below entiy also delet) 
* downstream services : សើវេស ហៅតគ្នា

==> Authentication and authorization mechanisms can be implemented at the edage server 
==> Full control 


--------------------------------------------

API Gateways is the server ==> How to implement it: we use Spring Cloud Gateway

- Stream line by emphasizing ease and efficiency. 
- It use reactive framework (reactive = non blocking) ល្បឿនលឿន
- Reactive don't block thread (request) 
- វានៅចន្លោះ រវាង អ្នក Request និង Resource 
- Inbound traffice Request ចូលមកនិងឆ្លើងកាត់ API Gateway នឹង
- API gateway ជា concerp and spring cloud gateway ជា Implementation 
spring cloud gateway the same as Spring developer. 

==> Spring cloud gateway is the middle of the request and resource : we can intercepts, analyzes, modifies every request. 


1. Client -> Gateway handler -> Predicate -> Pre Filter -> Post Filter->Resource-> Post Filter> Gateway handlter -> Client 

** Pre Filter : validation->include & exclude list-> authen&autoh->Rate limit->Day.....
** Post Filter : log time process and user log 


====================== Step To create gateway server =================

1. Spring Inizial 

Add: 

- actuator
- devtools
- eureka-client
- starter-config

2. Configure application.properties: Connect from gateway server to eureka serve 

spring.application.name=gatewayserver

spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8071/

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

## Configuring info endpoint
info.app.name=Gateway Server Microservice
info.app.description=Piseth Bank Gateway Server Application
info.app.version=1.0.0
management.info.env.enabled = true
management.endpoint.gateway.enabled=true
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true
#spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lowerCaseServiceId=true


3. Add configure server with Gateway server 
- create file : gatewayserver.properties

server.port=8072

eureka.instance.preferIpAddress=true
eureka.client.registerWithEureka=true
eureka.client.fetchRegistry=true
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:9000/eureka/


4. Testing : http://localhost:8072/actuator/gateway/routes

"predicate": "Paths: [/ACCOUNT/**], match trailing slash: true",
"metadata": {
"management.port": "8080"
},
"route_id": "ReactiveCompositeDiscoveryClient_ACCOUNT",
"filters": [
"[[RewritePath /ACCOUNT/?(?<remaining>.*) = '/${remaining}'], order = 1]"
],
"uri": "lb://ACCOUNT",
"order": 0
},
{
"predicate": "Paths: [/LOAN/**], match trailing slash: true",
"metadata": {
"management.port": "8090"
},
"route_id": "ReactiveCompositeDiscoveryClient_LOAN",
"filters": [
"[[RewritePath /LOAN/?(?<remaining>.*) = '/${remaining}'], order = 1]"
],
"uri": "lb://LOAN",
"order": 0
},

5. teshting with Postgraes

localhost:8072/ACCOUNT/api/accounts

We can customize latter on !
